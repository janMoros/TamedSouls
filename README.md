# TamedSouls
Action platformer videogame - Created with Godot for my bachelor's thesis.

# Introduction
This project is the practical part of my bachelor's thesis on Computer Engineering for Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.
The source code and assets can be found on the Godot Project directory. Outside of it, there is the final version of the game as a windows executable, and the Technical paper 
and presentation for the Thesis Defense, both in catalan.

# Abstract from the Technical paper
This article explains the development of Tamed Souls, a two-dimensional action-platformer videogame with elements from other genres such as Souls-like, created with the Godot engine. 
The world the game takes place in is proceduraly generated for each new game, and it contains prisoners to be rescued and campfires to find some rest after fighting against the 
enemies that plague the environment. Rivals have their own Artificial Intelligence, which allows them to develop attack strategies based on the player’s actions. 
At the end of the level a stronger enemy appears, with different movement and attack patterns: it must be defeated to finish the game. 
Current state of the game is rather satisfactory, having already a fully functional version that fulfills all the requirements planned at the beginning of this Bachelor's Thesis.
